<p>The coffee tree is a tropical evergreen shrub (genus Coffea) and grows between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The two most commercially important species grown are varieties of Coffea Arabica (Arabicas) and Coffea Canephora (Robustas).</p>
<p>The average Arabica plant is a large bush with dark-green oval leaves. The fruits, or cherries, are rounded and mature in 7 to 9 months; they usually contain two flat seeds, the coffee beans. When only one bean develops it is called a peaberry.</p>
<p>Robusta is a robust shrub or small tree that grows up to 10 metres high. The fruits are rounded and take up to 11 months to mature; the seeds are oval in shape and smaller than Arabica seeds.</p>
<p>Ideal average temperatures range between 15 to 24ºC for Arabica coffee and 24 to 30ºC for Robusta, which can flourish in hotter, harsher conditions. Coffee needs an annual rainfall of 1500 to 3000 mm, with Arabica needing less than other species. Whereas Robusta coffee can be grown between sea-level and about 800 metres, Arabica does best at higher altitudes and is often grown in hilly areas.</p>
<p><strong>   Harvesting</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86" src="https://thecoffeebean813.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4.png" alt="" width="253" height="199" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59" src="file:///C:/Users/THE%20OWNER/Desktop/tcb813-2/i0.wp.com/coffeebean506.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/46226.png?resize=253%2C199&amp;ssl=1" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" alt="4" width="253" height="199" /></p>
<p>As coffee is often grown in mountainous areas, widespread use of mechanical harvesters is not possible and the ripe coffee cherries are usually picked by hand. The main exception is Brazil, where the relatively flat landscape and immense size of the coffee fields allow for machinery use.</p>
<p>Coffee trees yield an average of 2 to 4 kilos of cherries and a good picker can harvest 45 to 90 kilos of coffee cherry per day; this will produce nine to 18 kilos of coffee beans.</p>
<p>Coffee is harvested in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strip Picked – all the cherries are stripped off of the branch at one time, either by machine or by hand.</li>
<li>Selectively Picked – only the ripe cherries are harvested and they are picked by hand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pickers check the trees every 8 to 10 days and individually pick only the fully ripe cherries. This method is labor intensive and more costly. Selective picking is primarily used for the finer Arabica beans.</p>

<p>Coffee intake has also been associated with a decreased incidence of chronic liver disease. The histologic benefit of coffee was first demonstrated by Modi <em>et al</em>. who examined the association between daily caffeine intake and severity of hepatic fibrosis amongst persons with chronic liver diseases. The authors described that daily caffeine intake above two cups of coffee was associated with lower rates of hepatic fibrosis. The observed protective relationship persisted after controlling for age, sex, race, liver disease, BMI, alcohol intake, and hepatitis C viral infection (HCV) infection. Of note was the fact that caffeine intake from non-coffee sources was not associated with decreased hepatic fibrosis. In a large cross-sectional US study, intake of regular ground coffee and caffeine intake was associated with a decreased risk of chronic liver disease. Persons included in the report were those with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, iron overload, impaired glucose metabolism, and excessive alcohol intake (&gt;2 alcoholic beverages per day). In the study, participants were followed for a median of 19 years, and those who drank greater than two cups of coffee daily had less than half the rate of chronic liver disease than those who drank less than one cup daily.</p>
<p><strong>Cirrhosis &amp; Mortality</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the decreased risk of chronic liver disease, coffee consumption has been associated with a decreased risk of cirrhosis. Two Italian hospital-based case-control studies found that coffee may delay the development of cirrhosis. The first study by Corrao <em>et al</em>. found a dose-dependent inverse relationship between caffeine intake and risk of cirrhosis. The odds ratios of cirrhosis development decreased from 1.0 (lifetime non-coffee drinkers) to 0.47, 0.23, 0.21, and 0.16 in those ingesting 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more cups of coffee daily respectively. A longer term follow-up in the same cohort confirmed earlier observations. The second study by Gallus <em>et al</em>. found an inverse relationship between coffee consumption and cirrhosis [odds ratio (OR) 0.54 for coffee drinkers compared to non-coffee drinkers; OR 0.29 for 3 or more cups daily]. An inverse relationship with duration of coffee consumption and cirrhosis also was observed (OR 0.45 for 40 years or more of coffee consumption).</p>
<p>The results of a large 10-year cohort follow-up study in the US revealed that coffee may be protective against both hospitalization and death from alcoholic cirrhosis. Subsequently, Klatsky <em>et al</em>. reported that coffee consumption may lead to a decreased mortality risk from nonalcoholic and alcoholic cirrhosis; the relative risk per cup of coffee daily was 0.77. Further expanding upon their original cohort study from 1992, Klatsky <em>et al</em>. presented a 22-year follow-up report in which they provided further evidence that increased coffee intake led to a decreased risk of alcoholic cirrhosis; with greater coffee intake associated with a lower relative risk of cirrhosis. There was no relationship between tea intake and the development of alcohol-related cirrhosis.</p>
<p>The inverse association between coffee intake and mortality from cirrhosis also was supported by a Norwegian cohort study by Tverdal <em>et al</em>. In the study, mortality rates were lower for persons drinking 3 or more cups of coffee daily compared to those drinking 2 or less cups. After adjusting for age, sex, alcohol use and other cardiovascular risk factors, similar benefits of coffee were also observed among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The relative risk of cirrhosis associated with an increase of two cups of coffee was 0.6.</p>
<p><strong>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</strong></p>
<p>Several studies have assessed the association between coffee consumption and NAFLD. In an analysis of four continuous cycles (2001–2008) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a dietary intake questionnaire collected by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that caffeine intake was independently associated with a decreased risk of development of NAFLD.</p>
<p>Two case control studies have suggested the beneficial effect of coffee on the risk of NAFLD as defined by abdominal imaging. Catalano <em>et al</em>. found that a decrease in fatty liver severity in coffee drinkers as compared to non-coffee drinkers. Also, coffee drinking was inversely associated with obesity and insulin resistance. A case control study performed in Mexico showed similar results with a dose-dependent reduction in coffee intake with increasing severity of hepatic steatosis. In addition, a cross-sectional study demonstrated that coffee consumption was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of hepatic fibrosis among patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In the study, an inverse relationship was found between coffee consumption and hepatic fibrosis. There was a significant difference between coffee consumption in patients with bland steatosis/not-NASH (<em>P</em> = 0.005), NASH Stage 0–1, and between NASH stage 0–1 and NASH stage 2–4 (<em>P</em> = 0.005).</p>
<p>The results of a recent European study provided further evidence regarding the protective effects of coffee in morbidly obese persons with NAFLD. Regular coffee consumption was associated with decreased liver fibrosis in morbidly obese women with NAFLD undergoing bariatric surgery. However, regular filtered coffee, but not espresso coffee, was found to be associated with the decreased likelihood of fibrosis.</p>

<p>To hear most recent research tell it, coffee is a miracle drink. The magic beans will ward off Skin Cancer and Alzheimers, reduces risk of Heart failure and Diabetes, heighten focus, and maybe even protect Liver health. Oh, and decrease suicide risk, according to the newest study that validates our coffee addictions.</p>
<p>According to a study performed by the Harvard School of Public Health and published this month in <em>The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry, </em>people who drink two to four cups of java each day are less likely to commit suicide than those who don’t drink coffee, drink decaf, or drink fewer than two cups each day. The study followed over 200,000 people for at least 16 years. And it’s not just a weak link: the researchers found that the suicide risk was cut by around 50 percent for caffeine fiends.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that researchers have discovered that coffee and smiles might go hand-in-hand. A 2011 study found that women who drink coffee cut their risk of depression by 15 percent compared to those who don’t. Michel Lucas, the head researcher of the most recent study, told The Huffington Post that coffee addicts can thank caffeine for the good news. The drug may actually act like a mild anti-depressant by tweaking levels of happy hormones like serotonin and dopamine.</p>

Ever wonder why so many of us make such a lustful beeline for our caffeine?  Could it be the oodles of antioxidants it contains? Or that science has revealed its health benefits, including lowered risk of diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, gallstones, and colon cancer? I don’t think that even these unquestionable virtues are what make coffee the highlight of your day. Then what does? The mood and energy-enhancing effects of caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and acts as an antidepressant by elevating serotonin and dopamine–it’s even been shown in the Archives of Internal Medicine to lower suicide rates. Some experience the mood boost more than others. Unknowingly, many people self-medicate depression with caffeine. How to know if you’re doing this versus just getting a beneficial pick-me-up? Some tip-offs: You consume more than four caffeinated beverages daily, including teas and diet sodas. Or you keep increasing your caffeine intake to feel less depressed, but it’s losing its effectiveness. I’m all for making the most of coffee’s therapeutic perks to allay low-level depression, but sometimes you may need other approaches when this emotion still persists. To find out if you’re self-medicating depression, you can stop your caffeine intake. After a month (most withdrawal symptoms, which include headache and fatigue, will be over by then) notice if you’re notably more depressed without caffeine, not always an easy experiment. Should you discover that you are self-medicating, also consider the numerous therapies discussed in this chapter to augment coffee, or to replace it. However, mild depressions can respond well to simply drinking up to three cups daily. (Try spacing them out; caffeine remains in the system four to six hours). More than this increases side effects and raises the chances of tolerance and addiction: You consume greater quantities but don’t get the lift. Always consider caffeine’s pluses and minuses. Reduce your intake if you have insomnia, heartburn, palpitations, headaches, or nervousness. Moreover, if you’re being treated for heart disease, hypertension, gastrointestinal problems, or other chronic illnesses, consult your physician before you ingest caffeine; although recent studies show coffee helps reduce risk of some chronic illnesses.</p>
